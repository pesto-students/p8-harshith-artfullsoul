## Project title
Assignment for Week-3.

## Motivation
This Project was a part of Assignment for Week-3. Here we were required to clone a the animation shared with us in the doc. 

## Assignment Details

### Assignment 3.1
The Code for Assignment-3.1 can be found in App.js file under comment "ASSIGNMENT 3.1".

### Assignment 3.2
The Code/Example for Assignment-3.2 can be found in App.js file under comment "ASSIGNMENT 3.2". <br>

- Bind -> The bind method in javascript is used to bind value to the this keywords. The values once binded are permanent and does not changes if tried to re bind.  
- Call -> The call keyword is simmillar to bind the only difference is that you can initialize different values to this keyword on different instances.

Output -> Count is 0.

### Assignment 3.4
- As per the concepts of closure any property of value which is not found in native scope is then looked to its next immediate parent scope. And we use the same concept here to solve the problem.
- The given example function returns the value of items which makes it accessible.
- While on the developed code in app.js under Assignment 3.4 we declare items using let keyword inside createStack function and does not return it. This makes it accessible within the scope.
